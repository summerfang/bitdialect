“Hello, everyone! Welcome to this tutorial on using Copilot to create a Python function that downloads stock prices. As a developer, you might need to fetch stock data for analysis, and Copilot can make this task easier. Let’s get started!”

“Imagine you’re building a financial application, and you want a function that can download stock prices based on their symbols (like SOXL and SOXS). Our goal is to create a Python function that accomplishes this.”

“Open your Python file, and let’s begin writing the function. We’ll call it step1_download_soxl_soxs_history.”

"Now, we need to fetch the stock data. Copilot can help us with this part. Let’s add the following code inside our function:

"Next, we want to save the stock data to a file named after the stock symbol. We’ll create a folder called ‘stocks’ where our Python file is located. Here’s how we’ll modify our function:

“And there you have it! We’ve created a function that downloads stock prices, saves them to a CSV file, and ensures the filename matches the stock symbol. Let’s test it out!”

“Look at this data – all generated by Copilot! We didn’t have to write every line manually. Copilot analyzed our prompt, understood our intent, and filled in the details. Amazing, right?”

“Thank you for watching! If you found this tutorial helpful, don’t forget to like and subscribe. Happy coding, and see you in the next video!”

Let’s ensure that the generated code is placed correctly within the __main__ block.
