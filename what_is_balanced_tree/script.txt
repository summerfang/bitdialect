What is a balanced tree?

A balanced tree in computer science is a tree data structure in which the height of the left and right subtrees of any node differs by no more than one.

This is an example of a balanced binary tree. In the subtrees of any node, the height difference is no more than one.

This is an example of an AVL tree, which is also a balanced binary tree.

This is an example of a red-black tree, which is also a balanced binary tree.

This is a B+ tree, which is also a balanced tree and can have more than two children.

The balanced tree is designed to maintain balance during data insertions and deletions, ensuring that operations like search, insert, and delete can occur in O(log n) time, where n represents the number of nodes in the tree.
